## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
An important tenet of healthcare is in obtaining the correct diagnosis for a patient. However, medical care is complex and involves multiple levels of care, administered by different specialties. Our group project addresses the need for primary care physicians to be able to diagnosis and triage eye conditions accurately. To this end, we designed a machine reasoning system to process the patient’s symptoms to reach a diagnosis or a list of differential diagnoses. To supplement the doctor’s capabilities, we have also added a feature to identify abnormal pupillary response, which can be indicative of a more serious eye condition.
